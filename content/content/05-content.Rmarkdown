## Content

- Power and the interplay between sample size, effect and power
- Measures of effect sizes
- Assumptions of the analysis of variance model 
    - Additivity
    - Homogeneity of variance and Levene's test
    - Independence


## Learning objectives

At the end of the session, students should be capable of

- produce graphical diagnostics and perform hypothesis tests to check the model assumptions
- think critically about the model assumptions as part of the model formulation
- deduce the sample size necessary to replicate a study at a given power 
- understand the interplay between power and effect.
