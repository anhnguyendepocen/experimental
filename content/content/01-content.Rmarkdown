## Content

- Syllabus and learning objectives
- Programming premises
- Motivation
	- Examples of experimental designs
	- Evidence-based policy
- Review
	- Population and samples

## Learning objectives

At the end of the session, students should be capable of

- using the basic vocabulary attached to experiments.
- assessing the generalizability of a study based on the description.
- distinguishing between observational and experimental studies.
- identifying experimental and observational units, treatments and blocking variables in an experimental study

## Case study

We will discuss the summary of ["The Impact of Mask Distribution and Promotion on Mask Uptake and COVID-19 in Bangladesh"](https://www.poverty-action.org/printpdf/47486) in class during the workshop. The [preprint of the paper](https://www.poverty-action.org/sites/default/files/publications/Mask_RCT____Symptomatic_Seropositivity_083121.pdf) contains additional information.

During the activity, you will be asked to identify in teams the following:

- the objective of the study
- the target population (which findings generalize?)
- the sampling scheme
- the observational and experimental units
- the treatments
- the outcome variable(s)



```{r show-youtube-list, echo=FALSE, results="asis", eval = FALSE}
youtube_list(slide_details, playlist_id)
```
