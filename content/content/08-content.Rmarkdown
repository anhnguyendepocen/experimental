## Content

- ANOVA as a linear model
- Sum of square decomposition for unbalanced designs

## Learning objectives

At the end of the session, students should be capable of

- fit general
- correctly specify a factorial design with unbalanced samples (sum-to-zero parametrization, sum of squares)
- fit a polynomial model for a single continuous factor and test for degree
