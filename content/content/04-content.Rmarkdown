## Content

- Reproducibility crisis
- Multiple testing
    - Family-wise error rate and false discovery rate
    - Procedures
    - Practice with **R**

## Learning objectives

At the end of the session, students should be capable of

- listing strategies to enhance reproducibility
- determining the number of tests in a family that need to be corrected for
- understanding how to correct _p_-values to account for multiple testing
- listing multiplicity testing methods suitable depending on context
- grasping the tradeoff between multiple testing and power

## Slides

The slides for today's lesson are available online as an HTML file. Use the buttons below to open the slides either as an interactive website or as a static PDF (for printing or storing for later). You can also click in the slides below and navigate through them with your left and right arrow keys.

`r blogdown::shortcode("slide-buttons")`

```{r show-slide-tabs, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
slide_tabs(slide_details, "/slides/04-slides.html")
```


## In-class

**Fun fact**: If you type <kbd>?</kbd> (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>) while going through the slides, you can see a list of special slide-specific commands.
{{% /div %}}



```{r show-youtube-list, echo=FALSE, results="asis", eval = FALSE}
