## Content

- Multiple testing
    - Family-wise error rate and false discovery rate
    - Procedures
    - Practice with **R**
- Assumptions of the analysis of variance model 
    - Additivity
    - Homogeneity of variance and Levene's test
    - Independence

## Learning objectives

At the end of the session, students should be capable of

- understand how to correct _p_-values to account for multiple testing
- grasp the tradeoff between multiple testing and power
- produce graphical diagnostics and perform hypothesis tests to check the model assumptions
- think critically about the model assumptions as part of the model formulation
