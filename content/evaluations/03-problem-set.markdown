# Task 1 - Model assumptions

The purpose of this exercise is to explore what happens when the model assumptions of the one-way analysis of variance go wrong using simulations. The interpretation of most statements we encounter (95% of the time) are to be understood in terms of repeated sampling and are valid with the assumption. We can create fake data in **R** and look at the *what if*. This is useful to build your intuition about what could go wrong, keeping in mind that you will have a single realization at end.

The workflow, coded for you ðŸ˜€, is the following:

Keppel and Wickens (p.Â 149) report some results.

# Task 2

Assess the hypothesis of the paper in @ from Problem set 2

# Task 3

Perform all pairwise comparisons for multiple comparisons and
