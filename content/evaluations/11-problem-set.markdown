## Task 1 - Mediation analysis

Study 4 of Risen & Gilovich (2008) (pp. 297-299) perform a mediation analysis with a two-way ANOVA using the Baron & Kenny (1986) methodology. Read the description and comment on the following aspects:

1.  use of the Baron and Kenny original testing procedure
2.  the plausibility of the causal model implied by the directed acyclic graph drawn in Figure 2, considering the study uses an experimental design and randomly allocates condition.

Using the summary statistics and coefficients estimates reported, recompute Sobel’s statistic[^1] and the *p*-value and compare them with the values reported.

Using Zhao et al. (2010)’s typology of mediation, identify the type of relationship in the mediation *lingo*. Read the justification of the authors: does the result seem plausible?
