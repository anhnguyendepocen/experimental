# Task 1 - Selective reporting and biased effect sizes

Check out [*Understanding `\(p\)`-values Through Simulations*](https://rpsychologist.com/pvalue/) by Kristopher Magnusson.

1.  Play with the app and report back whatever you learned in the process.
2.  What happens if you move the curve and start selectively reporting studies that show statistical significance (only 5% chance!) using the `\(p\)`-hacking tool? In particular, look at the discrepancy between the true effect size and the reported effect size. How might this affect calculations such as the one of Task 2?

# Task 2 - Power calculation for a replication study

Johnson et al. (2014) performs a replication study of Schnall, Benton, and Harvey (2008) who conjectured that physical cleanliness reduces the severity of moral judgments.
The following excerpt from the paper explain how sample size for the replication were calculated.

> In Experiment 2, the critical test of the cleanliness manipulation on ratings of morality was significant, `\(F(1, 41) = 7.81\)`, `\(p=0.01\)`, `\(d=0.87\)`, `\(N=44\)`. Assuming `\(\alpha=0.05\)`, the achieved power in this experiment was `\(0.80\)`. Our proposed research will attempt to replicate this experiment with a level of power = `\(0.99\)`. This will require a minimum of 100 participants (assuming equal sized groups with `\(d=0.87\)`) so we will collect data from 115 participants to ensure a properly powered sample in case of errors.

1.  Read the abstract of the paper. Are your surprised by the findings?
2.  In your own words, explain why it is incorrect to talk about ‘achieved power’ (aka observed power). *Hint: think back about Task 1*
3.  Validate the calculation provided in the quote.
4.  Calculate the sample size necessary to obtain power of `\(0.80\)` and `\(0.90\)` in case the true effect size was `\(d=0.01\)`.
