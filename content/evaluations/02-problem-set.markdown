TO BE COMPLETED

Using **R**, answer the following questions:

## Task 1: 

The standard error of the average difference between treatments `\(A\)` and `\(B\)` with equal variability is
$$
\text{std. dev} \times \sqrt{ \frac{1}{\text{nb of cases in }A} + \frac{1}{\text{nb of cases in }B}}
$$

- What is the best way to allocate a sample of 100 observations between the two groups? Create a plot illustrating the relationship between the number of observations assigned to treatment `\(A\)` versus `\(B\)` (the plot should give the variability on the `\(y\)`-axis and the sample size in say treatment group `\(A\)` on the `\(x\)`-axis. 
- What is the optimum share of cases for `\(A\)` versus `\(B\)`? Explain why this result is logical.
- Using the optimal fraction you identified, by how much does the standard error decreases if we increase the sample size hundred-fold, i.e., we go from 100 to 10,000 observations?
- Do you think we can act on the standard deviation `\(\text{std. dev}\)` term as experimenter? Why or why not, and what could it represent in your context.
