## Task 1 - Reporting guidelines and effect sizes

1.  Read Wilkinson (1999) guidelines for reporting statistical studies.
2.  Have a look at Kelley & Preacher (2012) and Lakens (2013) on definitions and reporting of effect size.

You do not need to hand in anything for this part of the assignment.

## Task 2 - Scientific writing

Your job is to put this suggestions into application for Study 2 of Risen & Gilovich (2008).[^1] [full text here](https://psycnet-apa-org.proxy2.hec.ca/fulltext/2008-09787-004.pdf) The data is taken from one of multiple replication studies and has been modified to make it balanced.[^2]
\> Using the undergraduate subsample, we conducted a 2 by 2 ANOVA with condition and gender as factors.

1.  Do the one-way analysis of Study 2.
    -   Check the assumptions of the test you are using.
    -   Justify and describe the results of your analyses as if you had to write them in an article.
    -   Insert only relevant output (statistics, tables graphs) in your written report.
2.  If you had to repeat this experiment, what sample size would you use? Justify your answer.
