I am not making you computer scientists
Words of wisdom from @allison_horst to her data analysis class this quarter: You don't need to be a mechanic to drive a car safely, and you don't need to be a computer scientist or developer to use R safely. #rstats #tidytuesday


https://twitter.com/ameliaritger/status/1214682596182904832?s=12

I always teach my students: there’s three levels of skill: driver, mechanic, engineer. You’re here to get your drivers license. But being able to change a tire can be helpful. Don’t worry not every one has to be an engineer. (I talk about R in social sciences)

R.A. Fisher worked 14 years at Rothamsted from 1919 and developed much of the theory underlying experimental design
See this recollection by Yates on his contribution: https://doi.org/10.2307/2528399 

Fisher was a eugenist and his views are largely decried nowadays.

.box-inv-5.medium[Student Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR)]



???

RAND: In a large-scale, multiyear experiment, participants who paid for a share of their health care used fewer health services than a comparison group given free care. It concluded that cost sharing reduced "inappropriate or unnecessary" medical care (overutilization), but also reduced "appropriate or needed" medical care.
https://www.rand.org/health-care/projects/hie.html

Tennessee's STAR project: smaller class sizes lead to better outcomes
"Over 7,000 students in 79 schools were randomly assigned into one of 3 interventions: small class (13 to 17 students per teacher), regular class (22 to 25 students per teacher), and regular-with-aide class (22 to 25 students with a full-time teacher's aide). Classroom teachers were also randomly assigned to the classes they would teach. The interventions were initiated as the students entered school in kindergarten and continued through third grade."

???

Control: Control for the (potential) effect of variables other than the ones directly being studied.
2. Randomize: Randomly assign subjects to treatments, and randomly sample from the population whenever possible.
3. Replicate: Within a study, replicate by collecting a sufficiently large
sample. Or replicate the entire study.
4. Block: If there are variables that are known or suspected to affect the response variable, first group subjects into blocks based on
these variables, and then randomize cases within each block to treatment groups.
