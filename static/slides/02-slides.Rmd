Not all samples are born alike
- Analogy: comparing kids (or siblings): not everyone look alike (except twins...)
- Chance and haphazard variability mean that we might have a good idea, but not exactly know the truth.

# The general recipe of hypothesis testing

.medium[
1. Define variables
2. Write down hypotheses ( $\mathscr{H}_0$ / $\mathscr{H}_a$ )
3. Choose and compute a test statistic
4. Compare the value to the null distribution (benchmark)
5. Compute the _p_-value
6. Conclude (reject/fail to reject)
7. Report findings

# Impact of encouragement on teaching

From Davison (2008), Example 9.2

> In an investigation on the teaching of arithmetic, 45 pupils were divided at random into five groups of nine. Groups A and B were taught in separate classes by the usual method. Groups C, D, and E were taught together for a number of days. On each day C were praised publicly for their work, D were publicly reproved and E were ignored. At the end of the period all pupils took a standard test.

One-way analysis of variance uses an $F$ statistic.

```{r aov, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
#one way analysis of variance
aov(data = arithmetic, 
         formula = y ~ group)
# can replace 'aov' by 'lm'
```

- In **R**, the function `anova` prints the analysis of variance table.
- The value of the statistic is 15.268.

# Possible, but not plausible

The null distribution tells us what are the plausible values for the statistic and there relative frequency 

- what can we expect to see **by chance** if there is **no difference** between groups.

```{r nullF, cache = TRUE, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 4}
stat <- broom::tidy(anova(lm(data = arithmetic, formula = y ~ group)))$statistic[1]
nrep <- 4999L
bootnull <- rep(0, nrep)
set.seed(1234)
for(i in 1:nrep){
 bootnull[i] <- 
   broom::tidy(
   anova(
     with(arithmetic,
          lm(y ~ sample(group,
                        size = nrow(arithmetic))
             )
          )
     )
   )$statistic[1]    
}
ggplot(tibble(statistic = c(bootnull, stat)),
       aes(x = statistic)) +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes( y = ..density..),
                 bins = 50L, alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = stat, col = 2) + 
  stat_function(fun = "df",
                n = 1001, 
                args = list(df1 = 4, df2 = 40)) +
  theme_bw()

```

Oftentimes, the null distribution comes with the test statistic

Alternatives include

- Large sample behaviour (asymptotic distribution)
- Resampling/bootstrap/permutation

# _P_-value

Null distributions are different, which makes comparisons uneasy.

- The _P_-values gives the probability of observing an outcome as extreme **if the null hypothesis was true**.

# Power

# I cried power!

The null alternative corresponds to a single value: $\mu_a = \cdots = \mu_e$.

whereas there are infinitely many alternatives...

Power is the ability to detect when the null is false, for a given alternative.
