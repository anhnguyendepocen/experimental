# Repeated measures

---
class: title title-8
# So far: between-design

Each subject (experimental unit) assigned to a single condition.

- individuals (subjects) are **nested** within condition/treatment.


In many instances, it may be possible to randomly assign multiple conditions to each experimental unit.

---
class: title title-8
# Benefits of within-designs

Assign (some or) all treatments to subjects and measure the response.

Benefits: 

- Filter out effect due to subject (like blocking):
  - increased precision of effect sizes
  - increased power (tests are based on within-subject variability)
- Each subject (experimental unit) serves as its own control (greater comparability among treatment conditions).

Impact: need smaller sample sizes than between-subjects designs

---
class: title title-8
# Drawbacks of within-designs

- Potential sources of bias
  - Period effect (e.g., practice or fatigue)
  - Carryover effects
  - Permanent change in the subject condition after a treatment
  - Loss of subjects over time

---
class: title title-8
# Minimizing sources of bias

- Randomize the order of treatment conditions among
subjects 
- or use a balanced crossover design and include the period and carryover effect in the statistical model (confounding or control variables to better isolate the treatment effect).
- Allow enough time between treatment conditions to reduce or eliminate period or carryover effects.

# Models for repeated measures

Consider a setting with one categorical variable indicating group membership (`id`) and an experimental factor $A$.

A repeated measure ANOVA is a model in which we fit both as factors.

# Mixed models

---
class: title title-7
# Why mixed models?

So far, we consider factors (treatment factor, blocking) as **fixed**

- Meaning their effect is constant

.box-inv-7[Change of scenery]

Assume that the levels of a factor form a random sample from a large population


---
class: title title-7
# Fixed vs random: no clear definition

Gelman (2005) lists a handfull of definitions:

> When a sample exhausts the population, the corresponding variable is fixed; when the sample is a small (i.e., negligible) part of the population the corresponding variable is random [Green and Tukey (1960)].

> Effects are fixed if they are interesting in themselves or random if there is interest in the underlying population (e.g., Searle, Casella and McCulloch [(1992), Section 1.4])
---
class: title title-7
# One-way ANOVA with random effects

As before, we have one experimental factor $A$ with $a$ levels, with

$$\underset{\text{response}\vphantom{l}}{Y_{ij}} = \underset{\text{global mean}}{\mu} + \underset{\text{random effect}}{A_i} + \underset{\text{error}\vphantom{l}}{\varepsilon_{ij}}$$

where $A_i \sim \mathsf{No}(0, \sigma^2_a)$ and $\varepsilon_{ij} \sim \mathsf{No}(0, \sigma^2_e)$ are random variables.

The errors and random effects are independent from one another.

The model **parameters** are $\mu$, $\sigma^2_a$ and $\sigma^2_e$.
---
class: title title-7
# Variance components

- The global average is $\mu$.
- The variance of the response $Y_{ij}$ is $\sigma^2_a + \sigma^2_e$.
- The **intra-class correlation** between observations in group $i$ is $\sigma^2_a/(\sigma^2_a + \sigma^2_e)$.

This dependence structure within group is termed **compound symmetry**.

---
class: title title-7
# Model assumptions

The validity of the $F$ null distribution relies on the model having the correct structure

- Same variance per observation
- equal correlation between measurements of the same subject
- normality of the random effect


- Can test for compound symmetry, but a weaker assumption is *sphericity* since we care about differences in treatment
- 
-
---

We can use the model to predict the values for $Y_{i\cdot}$.

Note: replications are needed to estimate effects (cannot estimate $\sigma^2_a$ if there is a single measurement per group).

# Nested versus crossed

.pull-left-wide[
Nested effects if a factor appears only within a particular level of another factor.

Crossed is for everything else (typically combinations of all factors).

# Formula for nested effects

**R** uses the following notation for nested effect: `group1/group2`, to mean `group2` is nested within `group1`. 
This formula expands to `group1 + group1:group2`

For crossed effects, use rather `group1*group2` which expands to `group1 + group2 + group1:group2`.

In package `lme4`, a random intercept per group is written `(1 | group1/group2)`.
