# I cried power!

The null alternative corresponds to a single value: $\mu_a = \cdots = \mu_e$.

--
  
  whereas there are infinitely many alternatives...

Power is the ability to detect when the null is false, for a given alternative.

In which of the two figures is power the largest?

# Parametrization

.box-inv-3.sp-after-half[Analysis of variance with $K$ groups]

.box-inv-3.sp-after-half[Population average of group $j$ is $\mu_j$]

.box-inv-3.sp-after-half[$n_j$ observations for group $j$]

We can parametrize the model in terms of global average in the sample,

\begin{align*}
\mu = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^K\sum_{i=1}^{n_j} \mu_j = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^K n_j \mu_j,
\end{align*}
where $n=n_1 + \cdots +n_K$ is the total sample size.

# What determines power?

--

1. The size of the effects, $\mu_1-\mu$, $\ldots$, $\mu_K-\mu$
2. The background noise (intrinsic variability, $\sigma^2$)
3. The level of the test, $\alpha$
4. The sample size in each group, $n_j$ 

???

The level is fixed, the noise level is oftentimes intrinsic to the measurement.

---

# Power and sample size calculations

Journals and grant agencies oftentimes require an estimate of the sample size needed for a study.

- large enough to pick-up effects of scientific interest (good signal-to-noise)
- efficient allocation of resources (not too large to waste time/money)

To replicate a study, one likewise needs to find the adequate number of participants needed.
