# Example from the OSC psychology replication



> The key statistics provided in the paper to test the “depletion” hypothesis is the main effect of a one-way ANOVA with three experimental conditions and confirmatory information processing as the dependent variable ( $F(2, 82) = 4.05$, $p = 0.02$, $\eta^2 = 0.09$). Considering the original effect size and an alpha of $0.05$ the sample size needed to achieve $90$% power is $132$ subjects.

Statistical significance $\neq$ practical relevance
]

With large enough sample size, **any** sized difference between treatments becomes statistically significant.

But whether this is important depends on the scientific question.

.box-inv-4[Example]

- What is the minimum difference between two treatments that would be large enough to justify commercialization of a drug?
- Tradeoff between efficacy of new treatment vs status quo, cost of drug, etc.

# Measures of effects



$F$-statistics and $p$-values are not good summaries of effect size:

- the larger the sample size, the bigger the statistic

Instead use

- standardized differences/measures
- percentage of variability explained

# Cohen's _d_

Standardized measure of effect (dimensionless=no units): 

Assuming equal variance $\sigma^2$, compare mean of two groups $i$ and $j$:

$$\begin{align*}
d = \frac{\mu_i - \mu_j}{\sigma}
\end{align*}$$

The usual estimator $\widehat{d}$ uses sample average of groups and the pooled variance $\widehat{\sigma}$.
.small[Note: a finite sample correction (Hedge) can be used.]

Cohen's _d_ is sometimes reported in terms of effect size
- small (_d=0.2_), medium (_d=0.5_) or large (_d=0.8_).

???

Note: this is not the $t$-statistic (the denominator is the estimated standard deviation, not the standard error of the mean

Note that there are multiple versions of Cohen's coefficients. 
These are the effects of the pwr package.
The small/medium/large effect size varies depending on the test! See the vignette of pwr for defaults.

class: title title-4
# Cohen's _f_

With more than two groups and assuming equal variance $\sigma^2$, compare the squared difference between overall mean and group mean

$$\begin{align*}
f^2 = \frac{1}{\sigma^2} \sum_{j=1}^k \frac{n_j}{n}(\mu_j - \mu)^2,
\end{align*}$$
a weighted sum of squared difference relative to the overall mean $\mu$.

For $k=2$ groups, $f=d/2$.

---
class: title title-4
# Effect size: proportion of variance

Break down the variability $\sigma^2_{\text{total}} = \sigma^2_{\text{resid}} + \sigma^2_{\text{effect}}$ and define the percentage of variability explained by the $\text{effect}$.
$$\eta^2 = \frac{\text{explained variability}}{\text{total variability}}= \frac{\sigma^2_{\text{effect}}}{\sigma^2_{\text{total}}}$$


Often, you see instead the partial value
$$\eta^2_p = \frac{\sigma^2_{\text{effect}}}{\sigma^2_{\text{error}}+\sigma^2_{\text{effect}}}.$$

.small[
Note: for a one-way ANOVA (no repeated measurements), the two are equivalent.

class: title title-4
# Coefficient of determination

For the balanced one-way ANOVA, typical estimator is

$$\begin{align*}
\widehat{R}{}^2 = \frac{F\nu_1}{F\nu_1 + \nu_2}
\end{align*}$$
where $\nu_1 = k-1$ and $\nu_2 = n-k$ are the degrees of freedom for the one-way ANOVA. 

- $\widehat{R}{}^2$ is an upward biased estimator (too large).
- People frequently write $\eta^2$ when they mean $\widehat{R}{}^2$
- for the replication, $\widehat{R}{}^2 = (4.05\times 2)/(4.05\times 2 + 82) = 0.09$


---
class: title title-4
# $\omega^2$ square

Another estimator of $\eta^2$ that is recommended in Keppel & Wickens (2004) for power calculations is $\widehat{\omega}^2$.

For one-way ANOVA, the latter is obtained from the $F$-statistic as

$$\begin{align*}
\widehat{\omega}^2 = \frac{\nu_1 (F-1)}{\nu_1(F-1)+n}
\end{align*}$$

- for the replication, $\widehat{\omega}^2 = \frac{3.05\times 2}{3.05\times 2 + 84} = 0.0677.$
- if the value returned is negative, report zero.
???

Since the $F$ statistic is approximately 1 on average, this measure removes the average.

class: title title-4
# Converting $\eta^2$ to Cohen's $f$

The software we will use take an estimate of Cohen's $f$ (or $f^2$) as input for the effect size.

Convert from one to the other:

$$f^2=\frac{\eta^2}{1-\eta^2}.$$


If we plug-in estimated values $\widehat{R}{}^2$ and $\widehat{\omega}^2$, we get $\widehat{f} = 0.314$ and $\widetilde{f} = 0.27$.

---

class: title title-4
# Comments on effect estimates

- There are two variants: population quantities (e.g., $\eta^2$) that depend on unknown parameters and sample estimates (e.g., $\widehat{R}^2$, $\widehat{\omega}^2$)
- In more complicated models, we can look at partial effects (proportion of variance relative to that of errors)
- Every effect size estimator is random (because its inputs are): **hugely uncertain**
- We can report confidence intervals with estimates (mostly for Cohen's $d$, but these are hopelessly wide in most settings).

# Living in an alternative world

Recall that with $K$ treatments (groups) $n$ observations, the $F$-statistic is

\begin{align*}
F =  \frac{\text{between sum of squares}/(K-1)}{\text{within sum of squares}/(n-K)}
\end{align*}

The null distribution is $F(K-1, n-K)$.

The denominator is an estimator of $\sigma^2$ under both the null and alternative.

So how does the _F_-test behaves under an alternative?

$$\begin{align*}
\Delta = \dfrac{\sum_{j=1}^K n_j(\mu_j - \mu)^2}{\sigma^2} = nf^2.

Recall: convert $\eta^2$ to Cohen's $f$ (the effect size reported in `pwr`) via $f^2=\eta^2/(1-\eta^2)$

Using $\widetilde{f}$ instead (from $\widehat{\omega}^2$) yields $n=59$ observations per group!

# Effect size estimates

.box-inv-7.large[WARNING!]

Most effects reported in the literature are severely inflated.

.box-7[Publication bias & the file drawer problem]

Estimates reported in meta-analysis, etc. are not reliable. Use scientific knowledge

Replication reveal serious need for shrinkage.

The estimated effects size also have uncertainty: thus report confidence intervals.

???

Recall the file drawer problem: most studies with small effects lead to *non significant results* and are not published. So the reported effects are larger than expected.

# Beware of small samples

Better to do a large replication than multiple small studies. 

Otherwise, you risk being in this situation:

```{r plot, echo = FALSE, out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/05/you-have-no-power-here.jpg")
```

# Observed (post-hoc) power

Sometimes, the estimated values of the effect size, etc. are used as plug-in.

The (estimated) effect size in studies are noisy! 


The post-hoc power estimate is also noisy and typically overoptimistic.

.box-inv-7[Statistical fallacy]

Because we reject a null doesn't mean the alternative is true.

When is this relevant? If the observed difference seem important (large), but there isn't enough evidence (too low signal-to-noise).

???

Not recommended unless the observed differences among
the means seem important in practice but
are not statistically significant
