# Block-treatment design

Without interaction,

$$\underset{\text{response}}{Y_{ij}\vphantom{\beta_j}} = \mu + \underset{\text{treatment}}{\alpha_i\vphantom{\beta_j}} + \underset{\text{blocking}}{\beta_j}+ \underset{\text{error}}{\varepsilon_{ij}\vphantom{\beta_j}}$$

Compromise between 

- reduced variability for residuals
- loss of degrees of freedom due to estimation of $\beta$'s.

# Example: Resting metabolic rate
From Dean, Voss and Draguljić (2017), Example 10.4.1 (p. 311)

> experiment that was run to compare the effects of inpatient and outpatient protocols on the in-laboratory measurement of resting metabolic rate (RMR) in humans. A previous study had indicated measurements of RMR on elderly individuals to be 8% higher using an outpatient protocol than with an inpatient protocol. If the measurements depend on the protocol, then comparison of the results of studies conducted by different laboratories using different protocols would be difficult. The experimenters hoped to conclude that the effect on RMR of different protocols was negligible.

???

The experimental treatments consisted of three protocols: (1) an inpatient protocol in which meals
were controlled—the patient was fed the evening meal and spent the night in the laboratory, then RMR
was measured in the morning; (2) an outpatient protocol in which meals were controlled—the patient
was fed the same evening meal at the laboratory but spent the night at home, then RMR was measured
in the morning; and (3) an outpatient protocol in which meals were not strictly controlled—the patient
was instructed to fast for 12 hours prior to measurement of RMR in the morning.

#  The microwave popcorn experiment

- **Response**: <s>weight</s>, <s>volume</s>, <s>number</s>, percentage of popped kernels.

# Omitting terms in a factorial design

The more levels and factors, the more parameters to estimate (and replications needed)
- Costly to get enough observations / power
- The assumption of normality becomes more critical when $r=2$!

It may be useful not to consider some interactions if they are known or (strongly) suspected not to be present

- If important interactions are omitted from the model, biased estimates/output!

- This is a very efficient design, but degrees of freedom of residuals tend to be low.
- Can have replications.
- The figure shown is one of many possible latin squares (we can permute rows and columns)
- Treatment is randomly allocated

# Guidelines for the interpretation of effects

Start with the most complicated term (top down)

- If the three-way interaction $ABC$ is significative:
   - don't interpret main effects or two-way interactions!
   - comparison is done cell by cell within each level
- If the $ABC$ term isn't significative:
	- can marginalize and interpret lower order terms

--

.box-inv-5[Analytical comparisons]

- Preplanned
- *Post-hoc*: after seeing that the three-way interaction isn't significative, compare all pairwise differences within two-way.

---

class: title title-5

# What contrasts are of interest?

- Can view a three-way ANOVA as a series of one-way ANOVA or two-way ANOVAs...

Depending on the goal, could compare for variable $A$
- marginal contrast $\psi_A$ (averaging over $B$ and $C$)
- marginal conditional contrast for particular subgroup: $\psi_A$ within $c_1$
- contrast involving two variables: $\psi_{AB}$
- contrast differences between treatment at $\psi_A \times B$, averaging over $C$.
- etc.

See [helper code](https://edsm.rbind.io/examples/example_threewayanova_contrasts.R) and chapter 22 of Keppel & Wickens (2004) for a detailed example.

# Effects and contrasts for microwave-popcorn

Following preplanned comparisons

- Which combo (brand, power, time) gives highest popping rate? (pairwise comparisons of all combos)
- Best brand overall (marginal means marginalizing over power and time, assuming no interaction)
- Effect of time and power on percentage of popped kernels 
   - pairwise comparison of time $\times$ power
   - main effect of power
   - main effect of time

# Semipartial effect sizes

Normally, partial effect sizes are of the form  
- if only experimental factors, $\sigma^2_{\text{effect}} / (\sigma^2_{\text{effect}} + \sigma^2_{\text{res}})$ for the given $\text{effect}$
- if only blocking factors, use total effect size $\sigma^2_{\text{effect}} / \sigma^2_{\text{total}}$
- if a mix, include variance of all blocking factors and interactions (only with effect!) in denominator.

If $A$ is effect of interest, $B$ is a blocking factor and $C$ is another experimental factor, use
$$\text{semipartial } \omega_A^2 = \frac{\sigma^2_A}{\sigma^2_A + \sigma^2_B + \sigma^2_{AB} + \sigma^2_{\text{res}}}.$$

# Power for complex studies

One can estimate (semi)partial effects and proceed as if you had a one-way ANOVA by specifying the missing ingredients.

- In more general settings, it may be easier to simulate from the fitted model directly and calculate the power as you change the number of observations per group.
