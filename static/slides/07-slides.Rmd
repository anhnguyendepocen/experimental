A $2 \times 2 \times 2$ factorial design with 8 treatments groups and $n=160$ undergraduates.

Setup: should a comprehensive exam be administered to bachelor students in their final year?

- **Response** Likert scale on $-5$ (do not agree at all) to $5$ (completely agree)
- **Factors**
	- $A$: strength of the argument (`strong` or `weak`)
	- $B$: involvement of students `low` (far away, in a long time) or  `high` (next year, at their university)
	- $C$: style of argument, either `regular` form or `rhetorical` (Don't you think?, ...)

#  The microwave popcorn experiment

What is the best brand of microwave popcorn? 

- **Factors**
	- brand (two national, one local)
	- power: 500W and 600W
	- time: 4, 4.5 and 5 minutes
- **Response**: <s>weight</s>, <s>volume</s>, <s>number</s>, percentage of popped kernels.
	- Pilot study showed average of 70% overall popped kernels (10% standard dev), timing values reasonable
	- Power calculation revealed $r=4$ replicates, but proceeded with $r=2$...

# Guidelines for the interpretation of effects

Start with the most complicated term (top down)
-If the three-way interaction $ABC$ is significative:
	- don't interpret main effects or two-way interactions!
	- comparison is done celle by cell within each level
- If the $ABC$ term isn't significative:
	- can marginalize and interpret lower order terms
	
## Analytical comparisons

- Preplanned
- *Post-hoc*: after seeing that the three-way interaction isn't significative, compare all pairwise differences within two-way.

# What contrasts are of interest?

- Can view a three-way ANOVA as a series of one-way ANOVA or two-way ANOVAs...

Depending on the goal, could compare for variable $A$

# Omitting terms in a factorial design

The more levels and factors, the more terms to estimate (and replications needed)
- Costly to get enough observations / power
- The assumption of normality becomes more critical when $r=2$!

It may be useful not to consider some interactions if they are known or (strongly) suspected not to be present

- If important interactions are omitted from the model, biased estimates/output!
---

# Block-treatment design

Without interaction,

$$\underset{\text{response}}{Y_{ij}} = \mu + \underset{\text{treatment}}{\alpha_i} + \underset{\text{blocking}}{\beta_j}+ \underset{\text{error}}{\varepsilon_{ij}}$$

# Latin square

A latin square is a blocked design with one treatment with $T$ levels and two blocking factors with also $T$ levels each.

Experiment arranged so that treatment is assigned once to each row/column. Letters correspond to the different treatments: 

.center.small[

|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| $A$ | $B$ | $C$ | $D$ |
| $B$ | $C$ | $D$ | $A$ |
| $C$ | $D$ | $A$ | $B$ |
| $D$ | $A$ | $B$ | $C$ |

.box-inv-4.small.sp-after-half[Example of a 4 latin square]
]
The model takes the form
$$\underset{\text{response}}{Y_{ijk}} = \mu + \underset{\text{treatment}}{\alpha_i} + \underset{\text{blocking (row)}}{\beta_j} + \underset{\text{blocking (col)}}{\gamma_k} + \underset{\text{error}}{\varepsilon_{ijk}}$$

There are $1+3\times(K-1)$ mean parameters to estimate, and **no interaction**.

Only effect of Interest is that of the treatment variables, $\alpha_i$.

Link with Sudokus!

- This is a very efficient design, but degrees of freedom of residuals tend to be low.
- Can have replications.
- The figure shown is one of many possible latin squares (we can permute rows and columns)
- Treatment is randomly allocated
