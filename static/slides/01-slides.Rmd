# Learning objectives
.pull-left[
.box-inv-6[Content]

- Basics of experimental design
- Statistical inference
- Programming in **R**
- Analysis of variance
- Intro to causal inference
- Mediation analysis

]

???

We will focus on simple designs as they lead to simple analysis. For more complicated schemes, consult an expert or find a collaborator.

The course content is first-year undergraduate, so the purpose is more one of numerical literacy then expert knowledge.

However, the assessment, activities and interdisciplinary skills are targeted for PhD students

We will spend a lot of time on ANOVA (one-way, two-way, multivariate, repeated measures, etc.)

- Scientific workflow
- Peer-review
- Reporting
- Statistical fallacies
- Reproducibility

???

The reproducibility crisis has changed the publishing landscape, so the requirements for publications are more stringent. I intend to cover these in details.

Statistical fallacies are common mistakes that discredit the validity of your work. Learning to recognize them in the wild is crucial (also as reviewer).

# Prerequisites

.box-6.medium[**Math skills**]

.box-inv-6.small.sp-after[Basic algebra]

.box-6.medium[**Computer science**]

.box-inv-6.small.sp-after[None]

.box-6.medium[**Statistics**]

.box-inv-6.small[At the level of OpenIntro Statistics (Chapter 1)]

???
More specifically for statistics:
- variable types (continuous, discrete, etc.) 
- basic graphs (histograms, scatterplots)
- hypothesis testing
- differences in mean (e.g., t-test)
- simple linear regression

# Programming

We will use the **R** programming language and the **RStudio** IDE

- free (!)
- open-source

Commercial software is expensive (e.g., SPSS licenses cost more than $5,730 USD per year as of 2021).

Words of wisdom from @allison_horst to her data analysis class this quarter: You don't need to be a mechanic to drive a car safely, and you don't need to be a computer scientist or developer to use R safely. #rstats #tidytuesday

I always teach my students: there’s three levels of skill: driver, mechanic, engineer. You’re here to get your drivers license. But being able to change a tire can be helpful. Don’t worry not every one has to be an engineer. (I talk about R in social sciences)

R.A. Fisher worked 14 years at Rothamsted from 1919 and developed much of the theory underlying experimental design
See this recollection by Yates on his contribution: https://doi.org/10.2307/2528399 

Fisher was a eugenist and his views are largely decried

# Experiments are still a thing 

Modern experiments: A/B testing

This illustrates changes to the design (Follow now high-contrast in black). This is an example of A/B testing common in web design.

Student Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR)
]



???

RAND: In a large-scale, multiyear experiment, participants who paid for a share of their health care used fewer health services than a comparison group given free care. It concluded that cost sharing reduced "inappropriate or unnecessary" medical care (overutilization), but also reduced "appropriate or needed" medical care.
https://www.rand.org/health-care/projects/hie.html

Tennessee's STAR project: smaller class sizes lead to better outcomes
"Over 7,000 students in 79 schools were randomly assigned into one of 3 interventions: small class (13 to 17 students per teacher), regular class (22 to 25 students per teacher), and regular-with-aide class (22 to 25 students with a full-time teacher's aide). Classroom teachers were also randomly assigned to the classes they would teach. The interventions were initiated as the students entered school in kindergarten and continued through third grade."

# Definitions

.box-inv-2.large[Experimental unit]

> Smallest division such that two units may receive different treatments in the actual experiment (Cox, 1958)

.box-inv-2.large[Treatment]


.box-inv-2.large[Observations]

---

class: title title-2
# Objective of the experiment

- Objective: compare multiple treatments
- Without treatment, variability in output
    - from one observation to the next
- Differences between treatment are comparatively stable


---
class: title title-2
# Experimental design

Experimenter must choose 
- **treatments** for comparison
- observations to be made (repetition, etc.)
- experimental units to be used

# Requirements for good experiments (1/2)

.box-inv-2.large[Absence of systematic error]

.center[Achieved via randomization]

--

.box-inv-2.large[Precision]

Depends on the intrinsic variability $+$ function of


1. accuracy of experimental work
2. number of experimental units / repetitions per unit
3. design and methods of analysis


---

class: title title-2
# Requirements for good experiments (2/2)

.box-inv-2.large[Range of validity]

- What is population?
- Identify restrictions
- Extrapolation only if proper sampling scheme

--

.box-inv-2.large[Simplicity of the design]

Leads to simple analysis 

???

Important: understand reasons for difference
- do not limit to experimental knowledge about the differences
