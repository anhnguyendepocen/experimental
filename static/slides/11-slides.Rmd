class: title title-5
# Motivation

Most experiments are inherently

.box-inv-5[Complicated]

We follow Oehlert approach and focus on restricted models (see Oehlert, 2001, p.286).

class: title title-5
# To-do list

Need to determine

1. sources of variation
2. relation between factors (nested or crossed)
3. nature of factors (fixed or random effects)
4. which interactions should be in the model.

- The statistical model must match the experiment design.
- For tests, need adequate denominators and degrees of freedom

# What is a Hasse diagram?


A graph in which every effect is a node
- Node labels indicate fixed vs (random) 
- superscript is number of instances
- subscript degrees of freedom
- lines joining variables show crossing/nesting relations and hierarchy

Useful for balanced designs

# Examples of Hasse diagrams

# Rules for testing (denominators)

From Oehlert (2001), Display 12.3

1. The denominator for testing a term $U$ is the leading eligible random term below $U$ in the Hasse diagram.
2. An eligible random term $V$ below $U$ is leading if there is no eligible random term that is above $V$ and below $U$.
3. If there are two or more leading eligible random terms, then we must use an approximate test.
4. In the restricted model, all random terms below $U$ are eligible except those that contain a fixed factor not found in $U$.

class: title title-5
# Degrees of freedom 

> Degrees of freedom for a term $U$ are found by starting with the superscript for $U$ and subtracting out the degrees of freedom for all terms above $U$.

# Two factors within-subjects designs

---

We observe $A \times B \times S$: each subject $S_i$ gets assigned to every treatment pair $a_j \times b_k$.
