# Motivational example

From Anandarajan et al. (2002), Canadian Accounting Perspective


> This study questions whether the current or proposed Canadian standard of disclosing a going-concern contingency is viewed as equivalent to the standard adopted in the United States by financial statement users. We examined loan officers’ perceptions across three different formats


---

# Alternative going-concern reporting formats

Bank loan officers were selected as the appropriate financial statement users for this study. 

Experiment was conducted on the user’s interpretation of a
going-concern contingency when it is provided in one of three
disclosure formats:

1. Integrated note (Canadian standard)
2. Stand-alone note (Proposed standard)
3. Stand-alone note plus modified report with explanatory
paragraph (standard adopted in US and other countries)

# Why use MANOVA?

1. Control experimentwise error
  - do a single test, reduces type I error
2. Detect differences in combination that would not be found with univariate tests
3. Increase power (context dependent)

---


# Multivariate model
Postulate the following model:
$$\boldsymbol{Y}_{ij} \sim \mathsf{No}_p(\boldsymbol{\mu}_j, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}), \qquad j = 1, \ldots J$$

Each response $\boldsymbol{Y}_{ij}$ is $p$-dimensional.

.small[

We assume multivariate measurements are independent of one another, with

- the same distribution
- same covariance matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$
- same mean vector $\boldsymbol{\mu}_j$  within each $j=1, \ldots, J$ experimental groups.  
   - (randomization)

]

The model is fitted using multivariate linear regression.

# Model assumptions

.box-inv-1[The more complex the model, the more assumptions...]


Same as ANOVA, with in addition


- The data follow a multivariate normal distribution 
  - Shapiro–Wilk test, univariate QQ-plots
- The covariance matrix is the same for all subjects
  - Box's $M$ test is often used, but highly sensitive to departures from the null (other assumptions impact the test)

Normality matters more in small samples.

---
# When to use MANOVA?

In addition, for this model to make sense, you need just enough correlation (Goldilock principle)

 - if correlation is weak, use univariate analyses 
   - (no gain from multivariate approach)
   - less power due to additional covariance parameter estimation
 - if correlation is too strong, redundancy
    - don't use Likert scales that measure a similar dimension

.box-inv-1[Only combine elements that theoretically or conceptually make sense together.]

---
# Testing equality of mean vectors

The null hypothesis is $\mathscr{H}_0: \boldsymbol{\mu}_1 = \cdots = \boldsymbol{\mu}_J$ against the alternative that at least one vector is different from the rest. The null imposes $(J-1) \times p$ restrictions on the parameters.

With $J=2$ (bivariate), the MANOVA test finds the best composite score with weights for $Y_{i1}$ and $Y_{i2}$ that maximizes the value of the $t$-test.

The null distribution is Hotelling's $T^2$, but a modification of the test statistic can be approximated by a $F$ distribution.


---
# Choice of test statistic

In higher dimensions, with $J \geq 3$, there are many statistics that can be used to test equality of mean.

The statistics are constructed from within/between sum covariance matrices.

These are

- Roy's largest root (most powerful provided all assumptions hold)
- Wilk's $\Lambda$: most powerful, most commonly used
- **Pillai's trace**: most robust choice for departures from normality or equality of covariance matrices

Most give similar conclusion, and they are all equivalent with $J=2$.

# Sample size for MANOVA

The number of observations must be sufficiently large to estimate all covariance parameters and mean parameters.


To achieve a power of 80%, need the following number of replicates **per group**.
.small[

```{r tablepowersamplesize, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE, output = "asis"}
library(tidyverse)
tab <- data.frame(
n = c(13,16,18,21,26,33,38,42,44,56,66,72,98,125,145,160,14,18,21,23,29,37,44,48,50,64,74,84,115,145,165,185,16,21,24,27,34,44,52,58,60,76,90,100,135,170,200,230),
ngroups = factor(rep(3:5, each = 16)),
ndep = factor(rep(c(2L,4L,6L,8L), length.out = 3*16)),
effects = factor(rep(rep(c("very large", "large", "medium", "small"), each = 4), length.out = 3*16))

library(kableExtra)

    col.names = c("effect size \\ p",rep(c("2","4","6","8"), length.out = 12))) %>%
  kable_classic() %>%
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "3 groups" = 4, "4 groups" = 4, "5 groups" = 4))
```

# Post hoc testing

Researchers often conduct *post hoc* univariate tests using univariate ANOVA.

This is suboptimal, rather proceed with descriptive discriminant analysis.

This method tries to find the combinations of the mean that provides the best difference between the difference groups.
