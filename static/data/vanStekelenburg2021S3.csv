I think we are eating enough of this without realizing it to establish that it often isn't dangerous at least in the short run.  I believe the health risk stems from two other issues.  First, as companies develop resistant strains to overcome loss of crops I believe we run the very strong risk of those issues becoming resistant and putting us into the same situation we are in with antibiotics now.  Overuse of prescriptions has led to super-bugs that often kill us and that have made hospitals very dangerous places to be.  I also know that the largest ag companies are selling altered seed that will only grow for one season.  My brother farms corn.  He cannot keep a portion of his harvest to replant next year because the plant is engineered to not reproduce.  First, it's not ethical but worse than that is the risk that something does not go according to plan, crops suddenly aren't enough for demand (or are somehow destroyed) and we can't grow more.  That's a terrifying risk to me.","first a general good search on the topic to see if there seems to be a consensus or if the subject is controversial amount topical experts","look at other article to see if they reference the same stats","search specifically for the study that gave the result being used -- if the publisher of the data can't point to a study or a primary source that can then the info isn't reliable and with or without intention is being fraudulently used","","","",NA,NA,4,5,4,4,7,4,4,7,1,7,1,7,2,1,3,2,3,"Independent Lean Republican","Moderate","United States of America","No",4,NA,NA,NA,"Undergraduate degree (BA/BSc/other)","Consensus",-1,32,-26.7965179542982,3,NA,4.57142857142857,0.570959121287871,0,0.570959121287871,12.413,158.389,"No","No","No",2,NA,"first a general good search on the topic to see if there seems to be a consensus or if the subject is controversial amount topical experts look at other article to see if they reference the same stats search specifically for the study that gave the result being used -- if the publisher of the data can't point to a study or a primary source that can then the info isn't reliable and with or without intention is being fraudulently used","y",3

That is the problem that I have about GE type foods. When does this stop? What other foods will scientists test that we may be eating? I have doubts as to the health factors that will affect our bodies from GE foods.  We know what foods that are naturally grown will help us stay healthy. But will that be the same with GE foods? Should scientists take the time and effort to explore this avenue? I think not?

I think this is an issue with a great deal more nuance, and it's frustrating that it's constantly being framed as, ""If you oppose Monsanto, you're an evil person who wants starving people to die of preventable famines and malnutrition."" The example of the disease-resistant bananas is one of GE being used for good, and I have no problem with that. The problem I have is that most of the GE food on the US market (where I personally live) is made by Monsanto to be more tolerant not to disease, but to Round-Up. Which means more Round-Up on the crops, which I DO think is bad for human health. It's also kind of, GE sometimes solves problems the hard way rather than the easy way--a lot of the vulnerability to crop disease can be handled via diversity of strains of crop, rather than the monocultures we grow now. And Monsanto has tried to put growers of heritage strains of crops out of business by charging them with copyright violations if any seed of theirs blows into the wind onto the other farmer's field, even though that farmer was likely trying NOT to grow Monsanto's crops. Additionally, a lot of the hunger in the world is due to distribution problems in capitalism and wealth inequality, not in there literally being an absence of food on planet Earth. We waste more than enough food to feed everyone who's hungry. So GE sometimes solves a problem that isn't quite the problem we actually had, and then that kind of gets used as apologia for Monsanto's BS. All that said, I don't have a problem with ethical and responsible uses of GE, even if I think it's sometimes building a spaceship to catch a mouse.","Think about how this fits in with what I already know.","Do a search on it, and see if credible sources confirm or deny it.","If it's ambiguous, find arguments for and against and see which seems most rational and thorough, and which seems to cherry-pick data or just make shit up.","","","",NA,NA,1,3,2,2,3,1,2,7,5,7,2,7,2,1,2,5,3,"Strong Democrat","Very liberal","United States of America","No",4,NA,NA,NA,"No formal qualification","Consensus",0,0,14.2034820457018,2.16666666666667,NA,2,-1.71287736386361,-1.84647522379509,-3.55935258765871,6.192,56.122,"No","No","Yes",3,NA,"Think about how this fits in with what I already know.

I know that GE food is necessary to sustain food for our over-populated need and that the effects are not immediate, but I can't help but think that changing the genetics of the things we consume is gradually changing our body's ability to get what we need from food in the first place. Clearly there are millions of other factors that play a more important role in our increasing issues, but in my opinion, messing with natural food production probably isn't helping.","Consider the source of the presented claim","Research reliable resources regarding the claim","Maintain a bit of skepticism","","","",NA,NA,1,3,3,4,4,3,4,6,7,7,1,6,2,4,5,2,1,"Independent Lean Republican","Moderate","United States of America","No",6,NA,NA,NA,"College / A levels","Consensus",-10,20,-0.796517954298153,1.16666666666667,NA,3.14285714285714,0.570959121287871,0,0.570959121287871,17.865,106.731,"Yes","Yes","Yes",1,NA,"Consider the source of the presented claim Research reliable resources regarding the claim Maintain a bit of skepticism","n",1
